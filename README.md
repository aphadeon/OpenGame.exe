# OpenGame.exe
A custom Ruby-powered game engine that supports RPG Maker games.  It aims to emulate the original 
RPG Maker functionality as closely as possible, and to later be expanded to provide new functions 
to empower RPG Maker games.

Usage
-----
OpenGame.exe acts as a drop-in replacement for RPG Maker's Game.exe. RPG Maker XP, VX, and Ace are 
supported.  Make sure you also add the dependency DLLs to the game's /System/ folder.
